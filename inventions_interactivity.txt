Chinese Inventions A-H by Yash Singh

This will show a bash script that I wrote in 402 lines of code that explains the inventions.
This script works on Mac and Linux without any extra interpreter installation. However, the script must be downloaded locally.
You can download the script from the Padlet and then run:

bash ~/Downloads/inventions_interactivity.sh

Windows users must install Git Bash first. I haven tested this on any other operating system then Linux, so if it doesn't work on Mac or Windows, comment on my Padlet post.

Instructions:

- Reply y or n to the questions
- Text will appear about each invention
- In the end you will be presented with three options
- If at any time it is desired to quit the script use the Ctrl+C command (Copy-paste works with Ctrl+Insert and Shift+Insert) 

Now let's see the real thing.
